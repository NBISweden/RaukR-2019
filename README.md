# RaukR 2019 â€¢ Teaching Materials

Welcome to the RaukR 2019 Teaching Materials GitHub repository.

## How to add my own materials?

* Fork this repository to your GitHub.
* Clone your fork to your computer.
* If you already have started preparing materials, copy the folders to `/docs/topic/presentation` and `/docs/topic/lab`.
* In the `/docs/topic/presentation` folder add all files needed to render the presentation and its rendered version in html. Just copy contents of the folder you have rendered in R-studio.
* In the `/docs/topic/lab` add all files needed to render the lab and its rendered version in html. Just copy contents of the folder you have rendered in R-studio.
* Add links to your rendered html files to `docs/index.md` so that the content can be seen [here](https://nbisweden.github.io/RaukR-2019/)
* Once you are happy, create a pull request (online) and assign someone as a reviewer.
* When you get back your reviewer's comments, address them and push them to your local fork.
* Assign yourself (online) or someone else to the pull request.
* Merge pull request (online).
* Continue making your materials even better. Create a new pull request when you achieve next milestone.

## Reviewer assignment.

* Assign as reviewer(s) your colleagues who can judge the content.

## As a reviewer.
* You do not need to do all the assignments and run all the code. Just check the slides are not missing or rendering in a wrong way. Also look if something is missing in the content or give suggestions on how to improve it.
* You can work in two ways:
    + clone your colleagues fork, work on her/his presentation slides/lab and pull request the changes that she/he will merge OR
    + just leave the comments in the pull request and let the author know.

## Seeing the content.

If you add to links to your rendered html files to `docs/index.md`, the content can be seen at: https://nbisweden.github.io/RaukR-2019/
